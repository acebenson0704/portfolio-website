# Tsao Chia-Cheng Protfolio Website

[https://portfolio-website-eta-three.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-website-eta-three.vercel.app/)

## Notes
This website is based on [Takuya Matsuyama](https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage)'s tutorial.

What's different:
  * JavaScript to TypeScript.
  * Rather than create pages for every works, use dynamic routes by ```works/[id].tsx```.
  * Parse markdown file as contents of works.
  * Replace voxel dog with my own blender works.
